## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- 
### What I learned

While working on this project, I got a better understanding of:

- **CSS Flexbox**: Used to center elements both vertically and horizontally.
- **Responsive Design**: Applied `@media queries` to make the layout adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Box Model & Spacing**: Learned how `padding`, `margin`, and `box-sizing` affect element positioning.

### Continued development

I want to improve my understanding of responsive design.  
In this project, I used `@media queries`, but I want to explore more advanced techniques  
like using `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()`, and fluid typography for better adaptability.
